- 👋 Hi, I’m @zyx-id
- 👀 I’m interested in ... fancy code and brilliant solutions
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Javascript
- 📫 How to reach me ... summon me

Since I got forced into automation due to situational reasons I am now persuing what I initially wanted; Computer Science -> developing
So to start it off Im learning to code Python.

Current plan:
Learn python - build a few projects that shows my skill; solutions, code efficiency, code structure
Learn JavaScript - build the back-end with django and front end using Javascript
Play around with flutter (dart) so implement a multi platform app(s) into my web-page so I can implement new content/adjust/anything crossplatform through my phone(android)
Use the web-page as my personal updates on what im working on
Apply for jobs as a developer once I feel contecnt with my allaround skills.

My overall goal is to find something I can focus on to contribute to metaverse and make a living on it.
